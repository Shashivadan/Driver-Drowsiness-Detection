Drowsiness Detection System
This project implements a drowsiness detection system using a webcam. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor a person's eyes and detect signs of drowsiness in real-time.

Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.x)
OpenCV (cv2)
dlib
NumPy
Flask
Pygame
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drowsiness-detection.git
Install the required Python packages. You can use pip to install them:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python dlib numpy flask pygame
Download the shape predictor model file from the dlib website:

Visit: http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
Extract the compressed file to the project directory.
Rename the extracted file to shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.
Usage
Run the Python script app.py:

Copy code
python app.py
Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000.

The webcam feed will be displayed with a drowsiness detection overlay.

If drowsiness is detected, a warning sound will play and a warning message will be displayed on the screen.

Customization
You can modify the drowsiness detection parameters by adjusting the ear_thresh value in the generate_frames function of app.py. This determines the number of consecutive frames with drowsiness detection before triggering the warning.
You can customize the HTML templates in the templates folder to change the appearance of the web interface.
